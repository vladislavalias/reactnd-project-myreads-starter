# MyReads Project

The MyReads Application developed by Vladislav Alias that allows you to manage your books using next shelves:
 - Currently reading
 - Want to read
 - Read

You can always add new book to appropriate shelf from the search page (right bottom + button).
Also you can put any book to any other shelf, once book put to `None` shelf it will be removed from your collection.
Enjoy my application, if you will have any questions or points to improve please contact me.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## What You're Getting
```bash
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── README.md - This file.

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    ├── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
    ├── SearchPage.css # Component that represents one of the Application Pages - Search page.
    └── Shelves.js # Component that renders all the Shelves and all the Books of our Application.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)
* [`shelves`](#shelves)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read", "none"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

### `shelves`

Method Signature:

```js
shelves()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection active shelves.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
